# Semantic Field Interference Network (SFIN)

## Overview

SFIN is an advanced neural language model architecture that incorporates quantum-inspired mechanisms into its attention and representation systems. Unlike traditional transformer-based language models, SFIN leverages complex-valued representations and quantum interference principles to model semantic relationships in text.

The core innovation of SFIN is treating language understanding as a quantum system where meanings exist in superposition and interfere with each other - similar to how concepts in human cognition can simultaneously hold multiple potential interpretations until context "collapses" them to specific meanings.

## Key Features

- **Complex-Valued Representations**: Uses both real and imaginary components for token embeddings, allowing for richer representational capacity
- **Quantum Entanglement in Attention**: Models dependencies between attention heads using entanglement matrices
- **Adaptive Interference**: Dynamically adjusts the strength of semantic interference during processing
- **Multi-Scale Interference**: Processes text at word, phrase, and sentence levels simultaneously 
- **Memory Augmentation**: External memory module inspired by Neural Turing Machines for enhanced context retention
- **Quantum-Inspired Evaluation**: Novel metrics based on quantum information theory
- **Explainable Interference**: Visualization tools for understanding the model's attention and interference patterns

## Architecture Details

SFIN consists of several innovative components:

1. **ComplexEmbedding**: Maps tokens to complex-valued vectors with adaptive scaling
2. **PositionalEncoding**: Complex-valued positional embeddings with learnable components
3. **EntangledInterferenceLayer**: Core attention mechanism with quantum noise injection
4. **HierarchicalInterferenceModule**: Multi-scale text processing system
5. **AdvancedWaveFunctionCollapse**: Final layer that converts complex states to token probabilities
6. **MemoryModule**: Attention-based external memory system
7. **CrossModalFusion**: Optional component for multi-modal capabilities

## Training and Evaluation

SFIN can be trained on standard language modeling tasks using next-token prediction. The provided implementation includes:

- Advanced training loop with curriculum learning for collapse mechanisms
